###  Titanic Classification
Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic
status, age, gender and more.

### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a 
passenger on the Titanic would have survived the sinking. By analyzing various passenger attributes, 
the model aims to identify the key factors that influenced survival rates.
